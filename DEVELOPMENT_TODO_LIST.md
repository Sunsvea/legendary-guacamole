## üéØ **Phase 1: Enhanced Terrain Analysis**

### **1.1 Realistic Hiking Cost Model** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
```typescript
interface TerrainCost {
  slope: number;        // Grade percentage
  surface: string;      // rock, trail, vegetation, scree
  difficulty: number;   // 1-5 scale
  timeMultiplier: number; // Speed reduction factor
}
```

**Implementation:**
- [x] **Slope analysis**: Calculate grade percentage (rise/run √ó 100)
- [x] **Tobler's hiking function**: Use proven formula for hiking speed on slopes
- [x] **Terrain penalties**: Different costs for different surface types
- [x] **Safety factors**: Exponential cost increase for dangerous grades (>45¬∞)
- [x] **Terrain Classification**: Automatic terrain type detection based on slope analysis
- [x] **Modular Design**: Extracted into dedicated `terrain-analyzer.ts` module

### **1.2 Multi-Source Elevation Data**
- [ ] **Current**: Open-Meteo (90m resolution)
- [ ] **Enhanced**: Integrate higher resolution DEM data
- [ ] **Validation**: Cross-reference multiple elevation sources
- [ ] **Interpolation**: Improved algorithms for between-point elevation

## üó∫Ô∏è **Phase 2: Trail Integration** 

### **2.1 OpenStreetMap Trail Data** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
```typescript
interface TrailSegment {
  coordinates: Coordinate[];
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'moderate' | 'difficult' | 'expert';
  surface: string;
  trail_visibility: string;
  sac_scale?: string; // Swiss Alpine Club scale
  isRoad: boolean;
  isWater: boolean;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- [x] **Existing paths**: Leverage established, safe routes
- [x] **Local knowledge**: Trails represent accumulated hiking wisdom
- [x] **Cost reduction**: Lower movement costs on marked trails
- [x] **Safety**: Avoid cliff faces, loose rock, unmarked terrain
- [x] **Spatial Indexing**: Efficient trail lookup with performance optimization
- [x] **Trail Detection**: Automatic trail snapping and linear route detection
- [x] **Trail Chaining**: Intelligent connection of trail segments

### **2.2 Mapbox Terrain Data**
Since you have full Mapbox API access, we can use:
- [ ] **Terrain RGB tiles**: High-resolution elevation data
- [ ] **Land cover data**: Vegetation, water, rock classification
- [ ] **Contour analysis**: Identify ridges, valleys, saddles

## üß† **Phase 3: Advanced Pathfinding**

### **3.1 Improved A* Algorithm**
```typescript
interface AdvancedPathfindingNode {
  coordinate: Coordinate;
  terrainType: TerrainType;
  onTrail: boolean;
  riskLevel: number;
  energyCost: number;
  timeCost: number;
  weatherFactor: number;
}
```

**Enhancements:**
- [ ] **Variable step sizes**: Smaller steps in complex terrain, larger on simple slopes
- [ ] **Direction weighting**: Prefer established switchback patterns
- [ ] **Risk assessment**: Avoid hazardous terrain (steep faces, loose rock)

### **3.2 Multi-Objective Optimization**
Consider multiple factors simultaneously:
- [ ] **Distance**: Shortest path
- [ ] **Time**: Fastest route considering terrain
- [ ] **Energy**: Least strenuous route
- [ ] **Safety**: Lowest risk route
- [ ] **Scenic**: Most interesting/beautiful route
